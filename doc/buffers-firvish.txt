Like |:ls| but implemented using firvish.nvim


Setup:

require("firvish").setup()
require("buffers-firvish").setup()
<

Invoke via |:Firvish|:

:Firvish[!] buffers [flags]
<

[!] has mostly the same effect as invoking |:ls| with bang.
That is, when [!] is included the list will show unlisted buffers
(the term "unlisted" is a bit confusing then...).

You can go to a specific buffer by moving the cursor to that line,
and hitting <CR>.

Indicators are the same as |:ls|.

[flags] can be any of the normal |:ls| flags in addition to:
        n       named buffers

As with |:ls|, combining flags "and"s them together.
Unlike |:ls|, when [!] is included along with [flags], combining
flags inverts the normal behavior. Thus:

`:Firvish buffers a+` will list all active, modified buffers

  whereas

`:Firvish! buffers a+` will list all inactive, unmodified buffers

Invoke via `firvish.extensions`:

>
require("firvish").extensions.buffers:open()
-- or, to pass arguments (e.g. flags)
require("firvish").extensions.buffers:run { ... }
